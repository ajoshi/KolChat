Mostly a way for me to learn about Kotlin, Room and all the fancy things they talked about at IO last year and this year. And probably next year as well.


### For cloners
If you're cloning this (I see you!): My older code is still fairly Java based and I'm still finding excessively Java-y code in the older Kotlin classes. It's a learning experience for us all, I guess, but just be warned that this probably isn't the nicest Kotlin project out there. I have a number of changes planned as well, so a lot of server responses are still in code comments.

Also, I'd **love** it if you'd star as well so my ego gets a big boost! 


### Setup

Import into Android Studio, install everything it wants you to install, run.
